## Hardware Requirements
Like any Cosmos-SDK chain, the hardware requirements are pretty modest.

### Minimum Hardware Requirements
 - 4x CPUs; the faster clock speed the better
 - 8GB RAM
 - 100GB of storage (SSD or NVME)
 - Permanent Internet connection (traffic will be minimal during testnet; 10Mbps will be plenty - for production at least 100Mbps is expected)

### Recommended Hardware Requirements 
 - 8x CPUs; the faster clock speed the better
 - 64GB RAM
 - 1TB of storage (SSD or NVME)
 - Permanent Internet connection (traffic will be minimal during testnet; 10Mbps will be plenty - for production at least 100Mbps is expected)
